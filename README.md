# Food Scan
 Barcode Scanning
# A.INTRODUCTION
## 1.Problem
Food is a part of our daily life, and a person cannot live without it. We shop to buy food. 
For some, it is very difficult to do this shopping. Because their body cannot get every 
nutrient. Therefore, their shopping becomes longer and more challenging. Because they 
have to check the inside of every product.
## 2.Solution
As a solution to this, I wanted to develop an application. Thus, shopping will be less tiring 
and easier. The application reads the barcode on the product and the product contents 
appear in the application, and the product features and warnings such as "You should not 
consume this" appear on the screen within the scope of the user previously marked.
